Save the Java source code provided in separate files with the .java extension. You should have four files: Main.java, TSP_DFS.java, TSP_UniformCost.java, and TSP_AStar.java.

The application will read input from the file lin105.tsp, perform computations for each algorithm (DFS, Uniform Cost, A*), and print the results to the console.

To modify the input you must provide another file of input data or modify the existing file
